          hey guys how you doing it's K here bringing another video on information technology I hope you're having a good day happy Saturday in this video we're going to go over um introduction to xdr what is xdr and I'm actually going to show you an example of xdr because I use Microsoft offender for work obviously you new to my channel know what to do rate comment subscribe give me a thumbs up really appreciate it so today we going to talk about the pros and cons of having an xdr solution understanding
          
          what is xdr understanding why we use xdr and also understanding um what can you do with xdr certain things you can do I want to go over certain cool things that you could do with xdr and and today I just want to share my screen hopefully give you some wisdom and some knowledge by the end of this video and as a security analyst you're like oh wow I didn't know you could do that oh wow yeah that is so true Kevin so let me share my screen and go over some cool stuff all right so today's video is about Microsoft Defender xdr and you're
          
          probably like xdr xdr this xdr that what is xdr right so here are some examples of xdr so you have Trend m you also have Paulo Alto you have S1 you have Cisco xdr you have CET 360 there are like so many examples out there of you know of xdr and you're probably like what the heck is that xdr so xdr is extended detection and response cyber security platforms that unify security tools and data to help organizations response to cyber attacks xdr uses Ai and automation to collect analyze and cor correlate data from multiple sources
          
          including endpoints uh networks Cloud environments and more so you you have your XDS and I'll just stop sharing for a second um you have your you let me just hide the stream you you have your XDS like like but I'm using Defender right now right and then your endp points would be like your computer your laptop Hardware related stuff right mobile device maybe this is part of your mobile device management for InTune right so those are your end points and xdr is specifically for Defender it like checks
          
          the checks that computer that computer has defender on it um or on a Mac or Windows machine it's going to give you alerts about it you're going to have incident in response alerts you're gonna get a bunch of alerts about different things whether they download a malicious software like malware maybe they they accidentally run something they weren't supposed to run or maybe they they've ran something that they were supposed to run and for some weird reason Defender is alerting you about it so you'll
          
          encounter that in your job if that makes sense okay I'm go back to share my screen and here is here is the importance of xdr um obviously xdr is EXT extension uh extension detective in response which I went over already and here's the importance of it so detect threats across multiple attack Services xdr K identify threats across a Varity Varity of domains including endpoints email Cloud infrastructure and more response to threats more quickly s can automate and accelerate detection investigation
          
          and response processes reduce alert fatigue could reduce the number of alerts that security analyst needs to access and you probably can't let me just this a littleit smaller all right here we go boost cyber Bo Cy boost cyber Insurance eligibility xdr can help reduce security risk and boost cyber Insurance eligibility so you get all these alerts right when you're security analyst like how do you respond to it right so obviously you want to make sure if their alert is legit or not so what what I
          
          mean by that if it's not a false positive and I'm going to increase the size of this you can see it so you may you may encounter false positives when a security system incorrectly identifies a legitimate activity or file as malicious so you may have to reach out to the Eng to see if the alert was real and me what I like to do I like to add screenshots and documentation on a ticketing system for alerts whether it's a dumb alert like God forbid an end user logs in he has a VPN he runs a VPN the VPN is
          
          putting him he's in the United States now the VPN is taking him to France you get an alert an incident response alert saying this end user just logged in with an un with unusual activity log going into France is this a normal or not normal and then you you get an alert on Defender saying that you reach out to the end user the end user is like hey Kev I'm using a VPN that's normal so obviously you know you should probably Mark that down as a false positive I am I am using VPN and I'm actually using a
          
          VPN and that's taking me to France or maybe the end us is traveling right from New York to Ireland and then it it says says it says uh incident alert and user just travel to Ireland is this normal activity is this normal for him to log in and that's probably not normal right you'll probably reach out and he'll tell you like oh um yeah Kev no no no that that was me that was me I logged in I logged into I loged in and it happened to be in Ireland right so you get alerts like that that's that's normal that's
          
          that's really normal um I said examples of false positives could be VPN maybe anti virus software which happens to get flagged for some weird reason as mware emails going back and forth from reg from a regular user so maybe have an email from an end user that they have like a strange email address but they're they're a business partner of your organization it just happens to be like a false positive because they have a weird email address that's not recognized by Defender right and it is happened to me last week someone's
          
          running a tool like mac cleaner on their machine and they haven't have a Mac machine and it's like what this this end user is running Mac cleaner it's not normal it's suspicious behavior and then please contact that user and you contact them is legit right maybe you have someone that is trying to log into a website and for some reason Defender is blocking that website and it's a legitimate website we don't know right and I'll go over that I'll go over how to block websites in in the next couple
          
          of minutes all right so yeah things like that if that makes sense so now that I'm done sharing this I want to share what we can do in Defender right so go to this one here is your Defender loging screen it looks like this obviously it looks different for every xdr tool I use it looks a little bit different from each one they all do the own unique thing right so for me all we care about is incidents so we go to incidents I don't have anything right here but maybe if you want to get alerts on incidents you should go to alert
          
          settings on the top right hand side and then what we could do is you go to email notifications and then here you could create your alerts right here so not sure why it's giving me that sh sometimes you know the defender is a little wonky but here we go and you go here and you see my name is there and you hit edit and you go to next here you can set up like send a notification per incident uh what notifications do you want I want EDR antivirus smart screen Defender xdr etc etc I wanted to I want
          
          to information if you informational it's not it's going to give you just information about it that's it right and if you add a service you can and then what we could do here as for testing purposes you actually could add an email here to see if it actually works so I added my email there already and you hit paste and you do send a test email and just give that a second something want try again this this Defender guess gets wonky sometimes and then you review your view your your uh rules and then you're all set after
          
          that and you hit submit so it's already set up for me so I don't got to do anything so I hit cancel and I should I should get an an alert or not alert but an email saying this email was sent by by Defender for xdr for Defender xdr for practice purposes y yada yada y right so just give that a second but I should get an email because I just sent a test email to see if this is actually legitimately working all right um and then the next thing you want we want to look at is uh onboarding right how do
          
          you onboard a device because I said you can onboard Mac and windows right and I literally just got an alert just now as I'm talking and speaking to you guys so look you get an email like this so this says Defender xdr let me just share that screen because you probably can't see it uh let me share my screen uh the entire window yeah so I just got an alert saying um yeah Defender for test Defender test notification for K Tech it you're receiving notification service because you are part of the email
          
          notification recipient you're receiveing email notification your with the following low medium high blah blah blah etc etc so go back to this one all right we're back on this one I close that and kill that yeah so if you want to unboard a device and if you go to settings you go to endpoints um and if you go to onboarding you have your devices right here onboard you do Windows 10 11 Windows 7 server 2019 Mac OSX Linux and then if you scroll all the way down you could do group policy you could do mobile device
          
          mobile device management Microsoft in tune BDI onboarding scripts like a virtual desktop inter probably for Citrix most likely um you have your down board download onboard package here as well and then you have your scripts you can run etc etc here also there is the option to block websites so how do you do that so if you go to Advanced features and if you scroll down and if you do web web content filtering you could turn this on and then you could save preferences right so now I just added this feature to for blocking stuff
          
          right and then what we could do is we could go to web content filtering right we could add a policy in here and then say block policy block policy for websites right and then you hit next and here you select what you want to block you could block porog graphy nudity gambling maybe um download sites maybe hacking illegal drug illegal software um games insta messaging chat maybe social networking like LinkedIn right etc etc and you hit next you hit next and you hit submit and then once that's done now it's gonna now
          
          Defender is going to try to be smart with AI and it's going to try to block certain websites that you're you're trying to go into if your computer has Defender install on it right it gets granular as you go into indicator so if you really want to block a certain thing you can if you go in here so if you go to URLs and domains and if you hit add an item and you put google.com it's going to ask you for a website google.com right if I could type today um and then you put block block policy right and then if you
          
          hit next you could hit block execution you could do warn audit or allow so you do audit and do next and it says your SEC you're alert so it'll give you an alert about that when someone when someone logs in it'll give you an alert about that person going to google.com right now you have an alert maybe maybe maybe you wanna maybe it's not google.com maybe it's YouTube maybe maybe you have someone that's going into YouTube for some weird reason and you don't want them to be on YouTube maybe it's facebook.com and you don't want
          
          them to go to facebook.com because you know we're we're working right and it where Facebook shouldn't even be allow right so maybe you want to block it or maybe you want to audit it just see if anyone's doing anything weird right and then you you just you could just put like informational for now and then here you going to you want to do you want to you want to collect a collection you want to know about uh initial access you want to know about malware you know there's all these things you could put
          
          in here suspicious activity right let's do collection you can do collection of miter techniques if you want right it gets really granular here like dacp SharePoint key logging right maybe maybe I want to do um maybe I want to do more like uh let's just go into suspicious activity and that's it and hit next and then this all the organ this is the whole organization it's GNA now it's going to put expires never audit response action nothing information or give me some information about the Su suspicious activity and that's it and
          
          then I could submit it right so something like that if you want to create something like that you can me you could do more than this that's just an example right so I'll stop sharing for now um so let's just stop sharing and go back to me yep and then that's it and that's it for me for today hopefully this helps you out if you're into Defender um now you know you could block websites you call whit list websites you can allow certain websites um you could put you could set up settings for malicious
          
          activity you could set up settings for anyone trying to go into certain categories that are characterized in the section for pornography etc etc education gambling blah blah blah so if you are a security analyst you know what I'm talking about you get false positives you to set up alerts you have to be so to type to compliant all this good stuff make sure you set all these things up make sure you have your instant response set up correctly n sometimes you get false positive that doesn't make make any sense so make sure
          
          you contact your end users if they actually are doing an activity and it's actually normal behavior we Mark that down as legitimate Behavior anyway with that being said hopefully this video helps you out and I hope you have a wonderful day and a wonderful Saturday take care peace bye
